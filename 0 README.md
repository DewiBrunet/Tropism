- What?  a workshop project proposed by Vulca  <img align="right" img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25649502/126064205-7574dc65-2f37-4fe0-92c9-b13df8bc733a.png" alt="alt text" width="150" height="150"> <img align="right" img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25649502/137733747-1d26cf5b-d9ea-4fc0-8e6d-80dd8700f3ce.jpg" alt="alt text" width="100" height="150">                 
- Who? created by Anne-Camille Gilbert and Dewi Brunet        
- When? 11 & 12 June 2022 during [Lighting Guerrilla 22](http://www.svetlobnagverila.net/en/team-members/plantoidori-robotic-origami-light/), 16th international festival of light        
- Were? at Rog Centre - Creative Hub, Ljubljana, Slovenia  
- Organised by? [Rog Centre Creative Hub](https://center-rog.si/en), [Vulca European Program](https://vulca.eu/), Lighting Guerrilla festival
              
## Were it all started
All great project start with creative minds wishing to collaborate and innovate by combining their field of expertise. We tend to oppose technology and ecology, manual and digital. Anne-Camille, an animatronics enthusiast maker, and Dewi, a folding expert, enjoy blurring these lines and want to prove that these seemingly opposite disciplines can be brought together for innovative and limitless creations.

[Dewi Brunet](https://dewiorigami.com/) (1990) is an artist and a master of paper folding. He explores folding techniques using a variety of materials and technologies, and also applies them in his art, design and science. He has been co-manager of the OpenFab fablab in Brussels since 2016, and is also a member of Le CRIMP, an international research centre for paper folding.

Anne-Camille Gilbert (1990) is a programming instructor and enthusiastic animatronics maker. She is committed to reduce the digital literacy gap between the generations and is also a co-founder of the OpenFab fab lab in Brussels.

     

## The inspiration
Biomimetism, sensitivity to nature & technology, folding

## The objective
<img align="left" img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25649502/137467702-7ab13a88-d03b-4ffd-9eda-1ae6cb96378e.gif" alt="alt text" width="250" height="180">
Tropism aims at creating a unique plantoïdori (plant-robot-folded) that will blossom according to an ultrasonic distance sensor. Whenever you place your hand close to the sensor, the flower will close… or open up, depending on your personality or mood. By adapting the code and the sensor
position , the creation will sense the invisible, fathoming the links between a virtual code and its real-world effects. 
The objective is to create a unique and customised flower lamp, combining electronics and folding techniques and introducing participants to several fablab technologies (laser, 3D, electronics)
