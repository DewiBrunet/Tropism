I will explain here how to fold the top part of the lamp. To be precise, we will use a special type of folding called "structured crumpling". This technique was invented by Paul Jackson and developed by Vincent Floderer and the CRIMP organisation that he created 20 years ago. It consists of a mix between : a classic geometric origami and an organised chaos of many folds.

Material needed : a thin paper of 30x30cm (I used baking white paper because it's thin yet strong)                  
Tools needed : your hands

## Step 1 : precreasing
Start with a square

Make two diagonal to have the center point

Add as many fold lines passing to the center point as possible (hint : it's even better if the folds are not in the same direction but alternating mountain/valley)

## Step 2 : radial crumpling      
Start pinching the center point in different directions.

Hold it tight and start crushing the paper firmly from the center point to the exterior. Do that several times. Caution : avoid movement of twisting.

## Step 3 : cutting to get a circle
Cut of the 4 side of the square to get a circle : crumple it again and cut through all the paper. Open it to see if it suits you, adjust with a few cuts if needed... and crumple it again (the more the better, it will be very important to make a loooot of folds).

## Step 4 : inner circle radial crumpling         
Grab a cup, make yourself a coffee or a tea, you deserve it. Wash the cup, keep the cup.

Take your folding and open it on top of your cup. Push inside the center of the paper. Gently open and pinch an inner circle onto the paper. Hint : I recommend a diameter of 7cm

Put a finger on the center point and close the folding on your finger to share the fold equally while crumpling it again

##  Step 5 : fine tune    
Gently open the folding. Pinch the central part (like in step 2) and try to separate it as much as possible from the other part of the paper - you can hold on to it further and further while closing the model. See back and forth if it suits you. Continue to open and add more and more crimp

Origami is hard, crumpling also, do not give up if it's your first try and you feel it's hard - that's normal "Sucking at something is the first step towards being sort of good at something" Jake
