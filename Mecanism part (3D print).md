There is 2 part for the mecanism,                    
one to transform the rotating movement of the motor into a linear one                    
and another part to transform this linear movement into a pentagone opening movement.

- 1 big print (+/-6h, 47g of PLA)                                                        
- 6 small print                                                          
- 6 wooden pike to brake at around 10 cm (depending on the length of the interior of your folding)
