All great project start with creative minds wishing to collaborate and innovate by combining their field of expertise.

They both met thanks to the fablab OpenFab in Brussels (Anne-Camille is one of the founder, Dewi a co-manager).       

Creating a origami-robot as been on their agenda for quite a while...
