- Who? created by Anne-Camille Gilbert and Dewi Brunet        
- When? during Digital November 2021        
- Were? at the fablab RogLab in Ljubljana       
- Organised and finance? by Institut Français and the Vulca program
              
## Were it all started
All great project start with creative minds wishing to collaborate and innovate by combining their field of expertise.

We tend to oppose technology and ecology, manual and digital. Anne-Camille, an animatronics enthusiast maker, and Dewi, a folding expert, enjoy blurring these lines and want to prove that these seemingly opposite disciplines can be brought together for innovative and limitless creations.

They both met thanks to the fablab OpenFab in Brussels (Anne-Camille is one of the founder, Dewi a co-manager). Creating a origami-robot as been on their agenda for quite a while... 

## The inspiration
Biomimetism, sensitivity to nature & technology, folding

## The objective
Tropism aims at creating a unique plantoïdori (plant-robot-folded) that will blossom according to an ultrasonic distance sensor. Whenever you place your hand close to the sensor, the flower will close… or open up, depending on your personality or mood. By adapting the code and the sensor
position , the creation will sense the invisible, fathoming the links between a virtual code and its real-world effects.

The objective is to create a unique and customised flower lamp, combining electronics and folding techniques and introducing participants to several fablab technologies (laser, 3D, electronics)
